Dumping everything from a NTFS device into another one in a form of unorganised files. And more on.

It is rather tricky to have something to be done like this one.  
Besides, noting is planned to do once finished dumping.  

## Q&A for myself (reminder):
Q: How to tell when is the end of a file?  
A: Use EOF from stdio.h  
Q: How to make those unorganised files organised?  
A: For every file, there would always be the file head and the file tail. Try to identify them.  
Q: Should I ask for help?  
A: Be bold, there's no shame.
